So, if I partially think that tech bros are degrading our culture why am I trying to join them?  Well, first, I don't think it is necessarily the tech industry ruining the culture.  I think it is more of a generation issue rather than an industrial one.  I think it is an issue of having a lot of money and not knowing what to do with it apart from pay off student loans and discuss craft beer.  I am going to miss so much of the delicious local brewers.

After deciding to move I began looking for a position in my field (arts administration).  I have about a decade's worth of experience, but found most positions to pay so little for the experience.  I even wonder if experience is actually valued.  I started realizing that a move can be a new definition/re-branding.  The more I began to explore the world of programming the more interested I became.  Granted, the culture of the industry seems a little less appealing, currently.  The US and the "American Dream" can mean a lot of things and is a little ridiculous, but it is still a pleace where you can change directions and try new things.  I'm slightly amused that I plan to leave an area that has so many tech jobs available right now, but it is exciting to create a new beginning separate from the culture I know here.
