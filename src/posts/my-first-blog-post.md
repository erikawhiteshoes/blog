If it were not for a kind landlord we never would have been able to afford housing in the Bay Area.  Rental prices in our "up-and-coming" community have doubled since we moved in 2008.  A two-bedroom apartment is, generally, $2800.  Artists, musicians and "the middle class" are moving farther and farther away in hopes to be able to afford their families or keep a creative lifestyle.We are a society that compares themselves to what others have (and not so much of what others don't have) constantly.  The tech industry has infiltrated the culture of San Francisco.  Businesses are catering to that community allowing property owners to raise rents so smaller businesses are priced out of the market. Each time I revist a former neighborhood there are more high-end apt. buildings and $4 toast.

Although, rents are ridiculous, my salary isn't reflecting the change, it is not a horrible life here by any means.  There are so many arts organizations thriving and still long-term residents keeping a little bit of the SF charm.  There is a lot of inexpensive and very good food.  Great produce, liberal-minded people, some who actually care about what is going on in the world at a deeper level.  However, the affordability does make one evaluate the factors that make their community livable.
